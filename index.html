    <h2>Efo Riro</h2>
    <p>
      This rich vegetable soup is native to the Yoruba people of South-Western
      Nigeria. The word, is derived from two Yoruba words, efo which means green
      leafy vegetable and riro which means to stir. One can, therefore, deduce
      from this synergy that efo riro is leafy vegetable that is stirred in rich
      pepper stock.

        fully cooked, add the Stockfish, boil till tender and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash your vegetables thoroughly with hot water to rid it of all traces
        of dirt, be careful not to in soak in hot water for too long so as to
        retain the nutrients. Slice or chop according to your preference and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the scotch bonnets and bell peppers and an onion coarsely and set

        minutes thereabouts or until the pepper dries out and the size reduces
        by almost half
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a bit of the meat stock/ chicken stock, if you haven’t got stock,
        just add water, be careful not to add too much. Just one cup should do.
